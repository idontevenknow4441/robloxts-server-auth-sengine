# robloxts-server-auth-sengine
Source Engine movement, mainly server with client sided prediction in Roblox using PRIMARILY, not fully (collision module is in Lua), TypeScript

Uses Chickynoid's CollisionModule.lua, credit to MrChickenRocket for that

And yes, I know the code is not the best, but I think you can understand what I tried (and somehow succesfully achieved to do), but most of this code is probably very unoptimized...

And I'm pretty sure there are also a lot of bugs but the main thing works, so.
